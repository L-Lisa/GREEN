# Project Green Fingers

This was the final Technigo project, it combines the MERN stack that we learnt over the course (MongoDB, Express, React, Node). I also took the freedom to play around with Bootstrap, use Canva or a layout and styled-components for the main styling.

## The problem

This was fun, we had a lot of freedome and I enjoyed finally putting a whole front and backend project together. I will be tinkering with this for some time to come. Let me know if you want to buy a plant!
